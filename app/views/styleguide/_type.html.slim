						| Shivering in the cold rain and we lose several cases overboard. In a few hours the weather starts to clear up and we get into the boat. We sail southwards to the island of New Zealand. All goes well in the first night and we find our way to a small island, the inhabitants of which are friendly. We take them off as we leave, and on the following day we sail for the New Guinea mainland.
